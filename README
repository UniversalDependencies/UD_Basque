Introduction

The Basque UD treebank is based on a conversion from part of the Basque Dependency Treebank (BDT), created at the University of of the Basque Country by the IXA NLP research group. The treebank consists of 5274 sentences (60563 tokens) and covers mainly literary and journalistic texts.

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Basque UD treebank is created through an automatic conversion of BDT data (Aduriz et al. 2003).

Sentences were randomized and divided in 60-20-20 splits for the train, dev and test files, repectively.
